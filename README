This is a lego box. It's like the lego boxes that may have filled your childhood with joy, excitement and adventure, but it's for programmers. It consists of data structures written in C completely from scratch. We have created this lego box for two reasons:

* We believe data structures are super important in programming and want to make sure we're fully acquainted with the various data structures out there. What better way to get acquainted with them than to actually create them?

* We think that they will come in handy for others who want to use them in their C (or a superset such as C++) programs. We hope that we can bring programmers such as ourselves joy, excitement and adventure by allowing them to focus on the logic behind their programs.

Create all the data structures!
