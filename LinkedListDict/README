This is a simple dictionary that allows you to insert, remove and find objects.
To use, create a single_ll typed variable, pass that variable (as a pointer) into
single_ll_init and then do as you wish with it. Before your single_ll variable
leaves scope of its function of inteded use, call single_ll_destroy on it to free
up any memory it is associated with. Please read through single_ll.c for more in-
depth summaries of each function.

To Test:

To test the dictionary, I have provided a make file that makes this easy. Simply
type 'make' in terminal and run the executable 'testDict'. Everything 'testDict'
tests is defined/implemented in 'test.c'.
